# MasterPlanner

This project serves to plan a Master of Mathematical Engineering at the KU Leuven.
Import the .py file in your preferred Python IDE and install the Tkinter module (in the right place!).
Then import the .sql file in your phpMyAdmin interface, as used in the course 'Gegevensbanken'.

A GUI should now pop up to let you choose subjects.
